/**
 * The specialization of a tensor with zero dimensions and exactly one value. In
 * detail, implementations have to guarantee the following:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Has exactly one value (not zero, no more)
 * <li>has always zero dimensions
 * <li>The only valid position to query is the 'empty' position
 * </ul>
 * Still, a scalar can have a context. Indeed, this is a very valuable property
 * in the framework of tensorics.
 * <p>
 * NOTE: It might sometimes be confusing, that in mathematics and commons
 * language the term 'scalar' is sometimes used interchangible for a
 * zero-dimensional tensor (what this class represents) and the values/entries
 * of the tensors itself. Therefore, we will denote the values of a tensor
 * (scalar) as 'values' and zero-dimensional tensors as scalars.

 * @param <V>
 *            the type of the value of the scalar
